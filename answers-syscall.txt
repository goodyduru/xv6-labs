Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
usertrap() function in kernel/trap.c

What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.
The value is 0x7 which represents the sys_exec call.

What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
User mode

Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
a3

Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
It crashes because we are trying to access a reserved memory address.

What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
Name: initcode, Process Id: 1
